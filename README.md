# SilverIsle

**Project Overview**
SilverIsle is an interactive web experience where users explore island-based zones to practise everyday digital skills. Instead of reading instructions, users learn by doing through guided actions, feedback and steady progression.

From the start, users are invited into a small island world with a reward waiting at the end. As they complete tasks and move through each island, they unlock their final treasure, a certificate that recognises their progress. SilverIsle turns digital learning into a journey that feels approachable, encouraging and open to both younger and older users.

**Design Process**
The design process for SilverIsle began with identifying a common challenge across generations which is how many people, especially the elderly and youths, feel uncertain or anxious when using digital tools hence we made a digital literacy web tool to help these users.

Rather than designing a traditional learning platform with long explanations, the project focuses on learning through guided interaction. The experience is structured around simple actions, clear feedback and gradual progression across island-based zones. The goal was to create a calm and approachable environment that reduces pressure while still maintaining engagement.

Users want to:
• Feel more confident using digital tools
• Understand how to stay safe online
• Practise real-world digital actions in a low-pressure environment
• Complete something meaningful and feel a sense of progress

SilverIsle supports these goals by:
• Breaking learning into small, manageable tasks
• Providing immediate visual and text feedback
• Allowing safe retry without penalties
• Using an island-based structure to create a sense of journey
• Offering a final certificate as symbolic recognition of progress

User Stories
• As an elderly beginner, I want to practise basic digital actions step by step, so that I can feel more confident using my device.
• As a user new to online safety, I want to try real-life scam scenarios, so that I can recognise suspicious messages in the future.
• As a cautious learner, I want to retry tasks without penalties, so that I can learn without feeling embarrassed or pressured.
• As a progress-driven user, I want to see clear completion milestones, so that I feel a sense of accomplishment.
• As a value-oriented user, I want to receive a certificate at the end of the journey, so that I know my effort has led to meaningful learning.
• As a self-paced learner, I want to explore islands at my own speed, so that I do not feel rushed or overwhelmed.
• As a younger user, I want interactive and engaging activities, so that learning about digital safety does not feel boring.
